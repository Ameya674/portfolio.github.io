# About Me

I'm a software developer with a passion for clean code and clever design. I love building open source tools, writing about tech, and learning about low-level systems and compilers.

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me reading about architecture (both digital and physical), experimenting with side projects, or contributing to GitHub.

- 🛠 Languages: Python, C++, Rust, Solidity
- ⚙️ Interests: Compilers, Systems, Web3, ML
